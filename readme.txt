=== SpanText ===

SpanText uses JavaScript to web text transform in real time to user interaction. 

Files included: 

    * spantext.js – the main script that makes the sliders and animates text.
    * spantext-nouislider.js – a modified noUiSlider that makes the sliders interface pretty.
    * spantext.css – Required CSS
	* spantext.php - required for WordPress only. Enqueues the JavaScript, CSS, and enables the shortcode.

Use the JavaScript files directly, or to install as a WordPress plugin, put the whole folder in wp-content/plugins/ folder.
